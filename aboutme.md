### Sup!
My name is Suraaj.
I am currently a CS undergrad @ IIT Roorkee. I have a passion for computer hardware and low level software

I love learning how things work and these are the problems that usually keep me up at night. I believe in quality education, where people learn something for life, and not just to pass a test or examination, and apply these to problems that they may face. 

Life is simple, and it is meant to be. I've always believed that great minds can understand difficult concepts, but the greatest minds can make them simple.
